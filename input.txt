Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurance of a data item (pixel in images). 
The principle is to use a lower z number of bitzs to encode the data that occurs more frequently. 
Codes are stored in a Code Book whichz may be constructed for each image or a set of images.
In all cases the code book plus encoded data zmust be transmitted to enable decoding.z
